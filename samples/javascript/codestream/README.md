# CodeStream, livestream your code

This is a sample application to demonstrate how to use Azure Web PubSub to livestream your code to others.

## How to use

1. Create an Azure Web PubSub resource
2. Go to "Keys" tab and copy the connection string
3. Run the following command with the connection string
   ```bash
   npm install
   node server "<connection-string>"
   ```
4. Open `http://loalhost:8080`, try to write some code in the code editor
5. Share the link at the top of the page to others, they will see how you code in real time

## How it works

### Server side

The server is express.js server which only does two things:

1. Serve a static web page (`public/index.html`)
2. A REST API (`/negotiate`) which returns a url to connect to Web PubSub

### Client side

The most logic of this app is happening at client side. In client there're two roles:

1. Streamer. Streamer is the one who writes code and broadcasts to others. It uses `WebSocket.send()` to send the changes from the code editor (by hooking the `editor.on('change')` event) to a group (whose ID is generated in negotiate) in Azure Web PubSub. And for performance consideration, it buffers the changes and send them in a batch every 200 milliseconds. The main implementation can be found at `startStream()` in `public/index.html`.

2. Watcher. Watcher is the one who watches streamer to code. It receives the changes from Azure Web PubSub and applies them one by one to the code editor (by calling the `applyDelta()` function). Since the changes is only a delta from the previous content there needs to be a way to get the full content from streamer when watcher is connected for the first time. So in this app when watcher is connected it will send a `sync` message to streamer (through another group called `{id}-control`) and streamer will send the full content to the group. The main implementation can be found at `watch()` in `public/index.html`.

Since the change is a delta the order of the message matters. So there is a version system (see the `version` variable and how it's used in `public/index.html`) to ensure the messages are processed in order. (For example, it won't apply changes until it receives the full content with a proper version.)

This is a site dedicated to showing developers what they can build with Azure Web PubSub through live demos. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a live demo is probably worth a lot more than that.

Azure Web PubSub is a cloud service that helps you build real-time messaging web applications using WebSockets and the publish-subscribe pattern easily. This real-time functionality allows publishing content updates between server and connected clients (for example a single page web application or mobile application). The clients do not need to poll the latest updates, or submit new HTTP requests for updates.

Check out the demos on the site and let us know what you think.

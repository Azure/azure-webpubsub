# Expose localhost for local development

## Use localtunnel to expose localhost

[localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) is an open-source project that help expose your localhost to public. [Install the tool](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel#installation) and run:

```bash
lt --port 5050 --print-requests
```

localtunnel will print out an url (`https://<domain-name>.loca.lt`) that can be accessed from internet, e.g. `https://xxx.loca.lt`.

> Tip:
> There is one known issue that [localtunnel goes offline when the server restarts](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel/issues/466) and [here is the workaround](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel/issues/466#issuecomment-1030599216)

There are also other tools to choose when debugging the webhook locally, for example, [ngrok](​https://ngrok.com/), [loophole](https://loophole.cloud/docs/), [TunnelRelay](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-tunnelrelay) or so. Some tools might have issue returning response headers correctly. Try the following command to see if the tool is working properly:

```bash
curl https://<domain-name>.loca.lt/eventhandler -X OPTIONS -H "WebHook-Request-Origin: *" -H "ce-awpsversion: 1.0" --ssl-no-revoke -i
```

Check if the response header contains `webhook-allowed-origin: *`. This curl command actually checks if the WebHook [abuse protection request](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-web-pubsub/reference-cloud-events#webhook-validation) can response with the expected header.

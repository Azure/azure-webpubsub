## Goals

Use Azure SignalR Service to handle pure WebSocket requests (without SignalR):
    
- Talk to an upstream application using HTTP protocol
- Handle connection connect/disconnect events
- Handle the WebSocket handshake, with the ability to configure the SubProtocol and reject connections
- Handle WebSocket messages, supporting both text and binary messages within one connection

## Non-Goals
- The upstream using persistent connection is out of scope.
- Supporting protocols where one protocol message is not bound to a single WebSocket frame is out of scope, e.g. MQTT.
- Supporting protocols where messages are having context or dependencies to previous messages is out of scope, e.g. streaming protocols.

## Terms

- **Upstream**: An upstream is the application that processes WebSocket connections and messages. This can be an azure function or any other application that can handle HTTP requests.
- **hub**: A hub is a unit of the isolation, the scope of users and message delivery is constrained to a hub. 
- **connectionId**: Every WebSocket connection has a unique `connectionId`.
- **userId**: Every connection has a user id from the authetication result if it is not an anonymous connection.


## Portal Configuration

1. The portal will support configuring WebSocket mode, from CLI and Azure portal. With WebSocket mode, only `/ws` requests are allowed.
2. The portal will support configuring Upstream settings from CLI and Azure portal.
3. The portal will support configuring the Auth settings talking to Upstream.

## Authentication

### Authentication between client and service

1. **Anonymous** - Authentication is handled by the Upstream.
1. **JWT tokens** - The service validates a JWT token based on the access key. (*TODO* add more details about generating JWT token).
1. **Client certificates** -  Certificate details to available via request header `X-ASRS-Client-Cert-Thumbprint`

### Authentication between service and webhook
1. Anonymous mode
1. Simple Auth that `code` is provided through the configured Webhook URL.
1. AAD Auth. 
   1. Add a client secret in AAD's [App Registrations] and provide the [client secret] to Azure SignalR through portal/cli.
   2. Provide the [Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity?tabs=dotnet) to Azure SignalR through portal/cli

## Client endpoint
For client endpoint, `hub` is an optional parameter and it is useful in isolating functionality  within a single service instance, for example, you can have both `/ws/client/hubs/notification` and `/ws/client/hubs/chat`. When the `hub` is not specified, the service internally creates a preserved hub `_default`. 

Below patterns are valid:

- `wss://{serviceUrl}/ws/client`
- `wss://{serviceUrl}/ws/client/hubs/{hub}`
- `wss://{serviceUrl}/ws/client?hubs={hub}`

## Upstream

The Upstream's settings can be configured from Azure portal or from CLI. The URL can be parameterized to support various patterns. 
        
There are 3 predefined parameters: 

1. `{hub}` 
1. `{category}`
1. `{event}`
        
The service calculates the value of the Upstream URL dynamically when the client request comes in. For example, when a request `/ws/client/hubs/chat` comes in, with a configured Upstream URL pattern `http://host.com/{hub}/api/{event}`, when the client connects, it will first POST to this URL: `http://host.com/chat/api/connect`. 

**Note: The value of these parameters are escaped when evaluating the Upstream URl. The `event` and `category` values will be illustrated later in this spec.**

### Upstream Request Validation

#### Goal

Provide a way for Upstream to verify if the requests are from ASRS instead of a third party.

#### Non-Goals

Prevent ASRS from calling invalid Upstream endpoint. For example, [LinkedIn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/api-guide/webhook-validation) uses a `challengeCode` request and expects a `challengeResponse`. As we support parameterization, Upstream endpoints are determined dynamically, so it is hard to validate the upstream endpoints when set, we can potentially  offer a feature for the customer to fill parameters to validate some particular endpoints manually.

#### Validating a request

The service will calcuate `SHA256` code for the `X-ASRS-Connection-Id` value using both primary access key and secondary access key as the HMAC key, and will set it in the `X-ASRS-Signature` header when making HTTP requests to the Upstream:

```
Hex_encoded(HMAC_SHA256(accessKey, connection-id))
```

## Communication

### Calling the Upstream from the Client
        
We leverage the HTTP protocol to deliver WebSocket messages to Upstream. A single WebSocket connection's lifecyle is as below: 

Handshake and Connect -> Handle Messages -> Disconnect
        
Each **event** in the above lifecycle belongs to a specific **category**. When event are triggered, the service makes an HTTP `POST` request to the Upstream URL, and delivers the HTTP response to the client if the response is non-empty. Details are described in [Protocol](#protocol-details) section.

### Calling the Client from the Upstream

The ASRS server tracks clients and has a result can be used to send messages to a specific client or a set of clients. You can use the [REST API](./ws.swagger.json) to send messages to clients.

| Actions | REST API With Default Hub | REST API With Specific Hub|
|----|----|----|
| Broadcast message | `POST /ws/api/messages?excluded={excludeConnectionId1}&excluded={excludeConnectionId2}` | `POST /ws/api/hubs/{hub}/messages?excluded={excludeConnectionId1}&excluded={excludeConnectionId2}` |
| Send message to user | `POST /ws/api/users/{id}/messages`| `POST /ws/api/hubs/{hub}/users/{id}/messages`|
| Send message to connection | `POST /ws/api/connections/{connectionId}/messages`| `POST /ws/api/hubs/{hub}/connections/{connectionId}/messages`|
| Add connection to group | `PUT /ws/api/groups/{group}/connections/{connectionId}`| `PUT /ws/api/hubs/{hub}/groups/{group}/connections/{connectionId}`|
| Remove connection from group| `DELETE /ws/api/groups/{group}/connections/{connectionId}`| `DELETE /ws/api/hubs/{hub}/groups/{group}/connections/{connectionId}`|
| Add user to group | `PUT /ws/api/users/{user}/groups/{group}`| `PUT /ws/api/hubs/{hub}/users/{user}/groups/{group}`|
| Remove user from group| `DELETE /ws/api/users/{user}/groups/{group}`| `DELETE /ws/api/hubs/{hub}/users/{user}/groups/{group}`|
| Send message to group| `POST /ws/api/groups/{group}/messages?excluded={excludeConnectionId1}&excluded={excludeConnectionId2}`| `POST /ws/api/hubs/{hub}/groups/{group}/messages?excluded={excludeConnectionId1}&excluded={excludeConnectionId2}`|
| Close connection| `DELETE /ws/api/connections/{connectionId}?reason={reason}`| `DELETE /ws/api/hubs/{hub}/connections/{connectionId}?reason={reason}`|
| Check if connection exists| `HEAD /ws/api/connections/{connectionId}` | `HEAD /ws/api/hubs/{hub}/connections/{connectionId}` |
| Check if user exists (has connections)| `HEAD /ws/api/users/{user}` | `HEAD /ws/api/hubs/{hub}/users/{user}` |

#### Body: `empty`

#### Response Headers:
*`?` to indicate this header is optional*

* `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol?`: `{subprotocol}`

The `connect` event forwards the subprotocol and authentication information to Upstream from the client. The Azure SignalR Service uses the status code to determine if the request will be upgraded to WebSocket protocol.

If the request contains the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header with one or multiple supported sub-protocols. The server should return one sub-protocol it supports. If the server doesn't want to use any subprotocols, it should **not** send the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header. [Sending a blank header is invalid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers#Subprotocols).

* `X-ASRS-User-Id?`: `{authed user id}`

As the service allows anonymous connections, it is the `connect` event's responsibility to tell the service the user id of the client connection. The Service will read the user id from the response header `X-ASRS-User-Id` if it exists. The connection will be dropped if user id cannot be read from the request claims nor the `connect` event's response header.

<a name="connect_response_header_group">
 
* `X-ASRS-Connection-Group?`: `{group}`

The header provides a convenient way for user to add this connection to one or multiple groups in response header. In this way, there is no need to have an additional call to add this connection to some group.

#### Response Status Codes:
* `2xx`: Success, the WebSocket connection is going to be established.
* `4xx`: Error, the response from Upstream will be returned as the response for the client request.

### Send Messages
The service calls the Upstream for every complete WebSocket message.

# Quickstart

## Create Your First Instance

Go to Azure Portal and search **Web PubSub** Service. Create your service with several clicks.

## Try A Live Demo

Quick start with this <a href="https://azure.github.io/azure-webpubsub/demos/clientpubsub" target="_blank">Live Demo</a>!

### Some hints

* The **Client Access URL** is copied from **Keys** tab. It is provided for quick test purpose. You can connect to the service using URL generated by this generator, e.g. `new WebSocket({generated_url})`. In real-world applications, SDKs are provided to generate client URLs from **Connection String**.

    ![Client URL](./../images/portal_client_url.png)

* Don't forget to check the roles of **Send To Groups** and **Join/Leave Groups**, and copy the **Client Access URL**.

* Try different groups to join and different groups to send messages to, and see what messages are received.

* You can also try uncheck **Roles** when generating the **Client URL** to see how sending messages to groups with that goes.

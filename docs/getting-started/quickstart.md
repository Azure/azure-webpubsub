# Quickstart

## Create Your First Instance

Go to Azure Portal and search **Web PubSub** Service. Create your service with several clicks.

## Get client URL with a temp access token

**Keys** tab contains the Connection String for the service, as well as a **Client URL Generator**. You can connect to the service using URL generated by this generator, e.g. `new WebSocket({generated_url})`.

![Client URL](./../images/portal_client_url.png)

- Connection: connection stands for a WebSocket client connection.
- Hub: hub is the logical isolation for connections. Connections always connect to a hub, connections can only send to those within the same hub.
- User ID: A connection can belong to a user when it is authed. 
- Token Lifetime: Specifies the lifetime of this client URL's token. When the token expires, you get 401 Unauthorized when connecting to the service with this URL.
- Roles: Specifies the roles for the connection. It can be used when the connection connects with `json.webpubsub.azure.v1` subprotocol. Here is a sample using the [subprotocol](./using-pubsub-subprotocol/js-work-with-subprotocols.md).

## Try A Live Demo
Check the roles of **Send To Groups** and **Join/Leave Groups**, and copy the **Client Access URL**.

Open <a href="../demos/clientpubsub.html" target="_blank">Client Pub/Sub Demo</a>, paste the **Client Access URL** and **Connect**. Try different groups to join and different groups to send messages to, and see what messages are received.

You can also try uncheck **Roles** when generating the **Client URL** to see how sending messages to groups with that goes.

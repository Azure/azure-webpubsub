# Azure Web PubSub protobuf protocol client for .NET

[Web PubSub](https://aka.ms/awps/doc) is an Azure-managed service that helps developers easily build web applications with real-time features and publish-subscribe patterns. Any scenario that requires real-time publish-subscribe messaging between server and clients or among clients can use Web PubSub. Traditional real-time features that often require polling from the server or submitting HTTP requests can also use Web PubSub.

You can use this library to add protobuf subprotocols including `protobuf.reliable.webpubsub.azure.v1` and `protobuf.webpubsub.azure.v1` support to the Azure.Messaging.WebPubSub.Client library.
